"""Round-8 correction: an observation must be CORRELATED to the connector under test.

The defect class this file pins had three instances in one slice, each looking like
a fix for the last: an artifact chosen by sort order, a flag read from the first
record, and then a flag aggregated over every record in the execution. All three
agreed with the archive, because every archived capture runs its connector
downstream of a `nodata` start shape — so the archive could not tell a correlated
read from an uncorrelated one, and three rounds of review passed on that agreement.

These tests supply the case the archive lacks.
